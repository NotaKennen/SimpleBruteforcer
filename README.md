A quite simple password bruteforcer, made for educational purposes only.

It asks you for a password, and then cracks it. Also tracks how much time it took.

If you would want to, but you shouldn't because this is for educational purposes and shouldn't be used for criminal activity, you could technically taking make it bruteforce websites
